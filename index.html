        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>This course is for anyone who is working in nutritional sciences or data related to nutrition. In this course, we will discuss the principles and calculations involved in nutrition. The following quantitative nutrition concepts will be covered in the course:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li> - Habitual nutrient intake and its estimation methods. </li>
            <li> - Dietary nutrient requirement and its determination. </li>
            <li> - The concept of nutrient inadequacy and its measures. </li>
            <li> - Computation of population level nutrient gaps to be met with fortification or supplementation. </li>
            <li> - Growth metrices and their application. </li>
        <ul>
