        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>This course is designed for anyone working in nutritional sciences or with data related to nutrition. We will explore the principles and calculations involved in nutrition. The following quantitative nutrition concepts will be covered:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li> - Habitual nutrient intake and methods for its estimation. </li>
            <li> - Dietary nutrient requirements and their determination. </li>
            <li> - The concept of nutrient inadequacy and its measures. </li>
            <li> - Computation of population-level nutrient gaps to address through fortification or supplementation. </li>
            <li> - Growth metrics and their application. </li>
        <ul>
